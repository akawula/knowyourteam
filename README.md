# Know Your Team
it's a UI tool to visualize github metrics for teams, such as:
- Number of Pull Requests
- Authors and number of PRs they made
- Code Churn - additions/deletions
- Time to merge pull request - average and median
- NO-JIRA % - if you are using JIRA in your workplace this tool will try to analize Pull Request title, commit's messages and branch name for obtaining JIRA key.
- Table with Pull Requests

## What I need to set it up?
- You need to be part of some Github Organization
- Personal github token
